Single C file creation:

If your can already compile the project with CMake, and wanted to try compile
with another compiler, but dont want to invest too much to fit the project to
the new build infrastructure, you can dump some handy suff from CMake and
Make.

The idea is to concaterate all the used C files into one huge file, then
compile only this one, therefore the simplest method can be used to compile
the whole (one file) project.

This workaround is used to compile the project with emscripten.

Utility location: tools/cmake/code_all_in_one.sh
